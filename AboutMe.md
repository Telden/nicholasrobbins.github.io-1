# Hello!

Currently I am a student at Champlain College of Vermont studying to become a professional game programmer. Despite not having any previous programming experience before entering college, I've worked diligently to acquire the skills neccissary to become the best possible game programmer that I can be. Presently, I am currently working on multiple projects, some of which you can find here. If you've got any questions about myself or any of my projects, I'd love to talk to you about them! Please email me at nhrobbins1@comcast.net with any of your questions.
