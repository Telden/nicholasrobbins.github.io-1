# **Game Engineering Thoughts**

Welcome to my game engine blog. Here, I will chronicle my work on my own game engine during the course of Champlain College's Game Engine
Design course. Along with what I learn there, I will also be using Jason Gregory's book *Game Engine Architecture* for topics that
go further beyond what is just told in the class. By far my favorite programming related to games are related to the game engine itself,
and I look forwards to working on my own engine.
